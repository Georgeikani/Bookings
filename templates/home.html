            <P>Your home away from home, but still feels like home. With our premium view and water park. A hotel is
                an establishment that provides paid lodging on a short-term basis. Facilities provided inside a
                hotel room may range from a modest-quality mattress in a small room to large suites with bigger,
                higher-quality beds, a dresser, a refrigerator and other kitchen facilities, upholstered chairs, a
                flat screen television, and en-suite bathrooms. Small, lower-priced hotels may offer only the most
                basic guest services and facilities. Larger, higher-priced hotels may provide additional guest
                facilities such as a swimming pool, business centre (with computers, printers, and other office
                equipment), childcare, conference and event facilities, tennis or basketball courts, gymnasium,
                restaurants, day spa, and social function services. Hotel rooms are usually numbered (or named in
                some smaller hotels and B&Bs) to allow guests to identify their room. Some boutique, high-end hotels
                have custom decorated rooms. Some hotels offer meals as part of a room and board arrangement. In
                Japan, capsule hotels provide a tiny room suitable only for sleeping and shared bathroom facilities.
